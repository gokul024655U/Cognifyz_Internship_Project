# 📊 Cognifyz Technologies – Data Science Internship  

This repository contains the tasks I completed during my **Data Science Internship** at [Cognifyz Technologies](https://www.cognifyz.com/).  
The internship focused on exploring, analyzing, and modeling restaurant dataset information to gain insights and build predictive models.

## ✅ Tasks Completed  

### 🔹 Level 1
- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**  
  - Checked dataset dimensions, missing values, and handled data cleaning.  
  - Analyzed target variable distribution ("Aggregate rating").  

- **Descriptive Analysis**  
  - Calculated statistical measures (mean, median, std).  
  - Explored categorical variables like *Country Code*, *City*, *Cuisines*.  
  - Identified top cuisines & cities with the highest restaurants.  

- **Geospatial Analysis**  
  - Visualized restaurant locations using latitude & longitude.  
  - Analyzed correlation between restaurant location and rating.

### 🔹 Level 2
- **Table Booking & Online Delivery**  
  - Compared ratings of restaurants with vs. without table booking.  
  - Analyzed online delivery availability across price ranges.  

- **Price Range Analysis**  
  - Identified common price ranges.  
  - Compared average ratings by price range.  

- **Feature Engineering**  
  - Created new features (e.g., length of name/address, booking/delivery flags).

### 🔹 Level 3
- **Predictive Modeling**  
  - Built regression models to predict *aggregate rating*.  
  - Compared Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest performance.  

- **Customer Preference Analysis**  
  - Analyzed cuisines vs. ratings.  
  - Identified most popular cuisines based on votes.  

- **Data Visualization**  
  - Used bar plots, histograms, scatter plots for insights.  
  - Compared city/cuisine-wise ratings visually.
